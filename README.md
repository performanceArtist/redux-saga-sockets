# redux-saga-sockets

Socket interface with redux-saga + Websocket and Socket.io implementations + IO and Websocket servers for testing.

## Project setup

Start socket.io server with `npm run server-io:dev`, websocket server with `npm run server-websocket:dev` or both with `npm run server:dev`.

Run `npm run client:dev` and navigate to localhost:3000.

You can also skip the first step or kill/restart server process - client should be able to reconnect automatically.
